# MERN Book Library App

This is a comprehensive guide to set up and use the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application for managing a book library.

## Features

- **View Books:** See a list of books with details such as title, author, genre, publication year, and ISBN.
- **Add New Books:** Easily add new books to the library.
- **Edit Book Details:** Modify existing book details as needed.
- **Delete Books:** Remove books from the library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your machine:

- **Node.js and npm:** Required for server and client-side development.
- **MongoDB:** Set up a MongoDB database.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-book-library.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd mern-book-library
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies for Server and Client:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

1. **Create a `.env` File:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    ```

    Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with the connection string for your MongoDB database.

2. **Update `apiUrl` Variable in `index.js`:**

    Update the `apiUrl` variable in `index.js` with the URL where your server is hosted.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Server:**

    ```bash
    node server.js
    
    ```

    The server will run on http://localhost:3001.

2. **Start the Client:**

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

    The React development server will run on http://localhost:3000.

3. **Open Your Browser:**

    Visit http://localhost:3000 to use the MERN Book Library App.
